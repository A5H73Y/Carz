Compatible Plugins
======

Carz is able to integrate with supported plugins to extend functionality. If integration is desired, make sure the plugin(s) are installed and start correctly, then Carz will display a success message on start up (if configured).

## Economy / Vault

## PlaceholderAPI

PlaceholderAPI support provides various available Carz placeholder values, which can be used to extend to other plugins to allow for better customisation.

### Carz Placeholders

Here are each of the available Placeholders that Carz provides.

```
%carz_fuelgauge%
%carz_speed%
%carz_fuel%
%carz_maxfuel%
%carz_cartype%
```

## BountifulAPI

BountifulAPI supports the ability to display titles and various other notifications on older server versions, rather than printing the messages into the chat.

Once connected, Carz will use the action bar to display the remaining fuel when requested and various other messages.

_Spigot's implementation will be attempted first, then fallback to BountifulAPI if installed._
