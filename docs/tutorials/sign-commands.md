Sign Commands
======

Vehiclez command usage can be completely disabled in the config to allow for full immersion of role-play by using signs for every Vehiclez function. This includes: buying a car, upgrading a car, and refueling your car. Ideally you could have a different building for each of these purposes.

If Vehiclez is linked to an Economy plugin, the cost of the purchase will be displayed at the bottom of the sign.  
_You are able to override the default cost by entering a number at the bottom (forth line) of the sign, which will be the new cost of the purchase._

**If Vehiclez signs aren't working for non-ops, this will be because of an external reason. This could include the server.properties spawn-protection or a 3rd party plugin, and not because of the Vehiclez plugin.**

## Purchase Car

A Car Purchase will give the ability for the player to own a car, the type of Car to purchase will be specified on the third line.

## Refuel Car

A Car's fuel will need to be refilled regularly so it doesn't run out while driving. This can be achieved by using a Refuelling the car, which will set the amount of fuel to the Car's max capacity.
_If Economy is enabled, you can configure the cost to adjust to the amount of fuel remaining. i.e. if there is 1/2 of fuel remaining in the car, the cost will be 1/2 of the original._
